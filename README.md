# Study Companion
StudyCompanion is a program developed to help study any topic. The program is able to track multiple subjects, called StudySets, each with their own set of materials. As of now, these include Decks and Quizzes.
A Deck is like a set of flashcards, in which Cards have a question and answer components that a user can review with.
A Quiz consists of Questions, such as true/false, multiple choice, or text-based entries.

## Installation
Simply run the included StudyCompanion.jar file or compile the code in the src folder and run Main.java. Please see our Assembla Software Documentation page for more details. A sample StudySet "Math 101.xml" is also included.
